                        Welcome to the NY.pm - or as we like to say 
                        /New York Perl M((o|u)ngers|aniacs)*/.
                        Perl Mongers is a loose confederation of Perl hackers,
                        coders, and accidental programmers whose goal is
                        to develop the social community of Perl - after all, it's 
                        more than a language - it's a culture and a floor wax.

<h2>Emergency Social Meeting Jun 30 2010</h2>

<p>

Paul Fenwick asked me if we were having a meeting and I said "sure!" So we're meeting at the Peculier Pub (145 Bleecker Street, Near LaGuardia Place) on June 30th at 7pm.

<p>

See you there!

<p>

<h4>Regular monthly meetings (for various values of "regular")(Which,
lately has meant "anything <em>but</em> regular...")</h4> We used to
generally get together the third Thursday of the month, formerly often
at <a href="http://www.evolution.com">Evolution Online Systems</a> (34
W. 17th Street, 2nd fl.).  Bringing food/drink/toys/whatever...
Lately things have been a lot less predictable.

<hr> <h2>Old News (from here on down, you're in the dim and distant
past... if you try to go to these meetings, you will be disappointed.)</h2>

<h3>Confound your enemies!  Confuse your friends!</h3><p>

For May, the "third" Thursday is again actually the fourth...  April
Fools day didn't count, you see.  Ok, maybe not...  So, we'll be
meeting at at <a href="http://www.drinkgoodstuff.com">d.b.a.</a> -
41 First Avenue, between 2nd and 3rd Streets (...and looky here: a <a
href="http://www.drinkgoodstuff.com/dbainfo.htm">map!</a>) - at 7:30pm
(although some might show up early...) on Thursday the 27th of May.
From there, we will most likely move on to dinner somewhere.  See you
there.

<p>

<em>May bonus attraction:</em> Good beer and other forms of alcohol.
If you don't drink, we can always talk about The Phantom Menace or
something...


<p>

<h2>Failed experiment</h2>

<h5>(The following had such potential, but the weather and time of year
were, it seems, against us...)</h5>

<h3><em>Alert!  Emergency drink-a-thon!</em></h3>
<em>Place now determined!</em>

<p>
Due to special circumstances (i. e. someone suggested it), some
ny.pm'ers shall be heading out for a pre-holiday imbibing session.
<p>
Time seems to be about 7pm on Thursday Dec 24, at d.b.a. - 41 First
Avenue, between 2nd and 3rd Streets.  For more info on d.b.a., check
out &lt;http://www.nycbeer.org/site.cgi?taste+dba&gt;.
<p>
Hope to see you all there!
