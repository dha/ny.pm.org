			Welcome to the NY.pm - or as we like to say 
			/New York Perl M((o|u)ngers|aniacs)*/.
			Perl Mongers is a loose confederation of Perl hackers,
			coders, and accidental programmers whose goal is
			to develop the social community of Perl - after all, it's 
			more than a language - it's a culture and a floor wax.
