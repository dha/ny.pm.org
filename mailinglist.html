<tt>Those who are both New York area Perl programmers and in the know, religiously read and post to the very finest fountain of information, the ny.pm mailing list.</tt>

<h3>As of Monday the 27th of February, 2006, the mailing list was having some problems. These have now been solved. Thanks for your patience.</h3>

<blockquote><h4><em>Note:</em>  ny.pm is a list devoted to the activities of
ny.pm.  It is not generally a technical list.  It is
	  <em>definitely</em> not a help desk or a job forum.</h4></blockquote>

<tt>For those New York area Perl progammers in the know and looking
for work (or employees), we used to have a New York Perl
Jobs Mailing List.</tt>

<blockquote>Times, however have changed. The list came to be rarely
used and has been deactivated. A big reason for this was the creation
of <a href="http://jobs.perl.org">http://jobs.perl.org</a>, which
serves as a more general jobs resource and is where you should now
look for the things the nyc-perl-jobs list used to do.</blockquote>
