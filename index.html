                <strong>Perl Mongers</strong> is a loose confederation of Perl hackers,
                coders, and accidental programmers whose goal is
                to develop the social community of Perl - after all, it's 
                more than a language - it's a culture <em>and</em> a floor wax.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>New York Perl Mongers</strong> is oldest Perl Mongers group in the world, 
                created by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_D_Foy">brian d foy</a> in 1997 at the 
                First O'Reilly Perl Conference (which later went on to become <a href="http://www.oscon.com">OSCON</a>).
