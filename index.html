            Welcome to the <strong>NY.pm</strong> - or as we like to say 
            <strong class=nobr>/New York Perl M((o|u)ngers|aniacs)*/</strong>.
            Perl Mongers is a loose confederation of Perl hackers,
            coders, and accidental programmers whose goal is
            to develop the social community of Perl - after all, it's 
            more than a language - it's a culture <em>and</em> a floor wax.
