        <p>
            Perl Mongers is a loose confederation of Perl hackers,
            coders, and accidental programmers whose goal is
            to develop the social community of Perl - after all, it's 
            more than a language - it's a culture <em>and</em> a floor wax.
        </p>
        
        <h2>No Ordinary Perl Mongers</h2>
        <p>
            New York Perl Mongers was the first ever <a href="http://www.pm.org">Perl Mongers</a> group, 
            created by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_D_Foy">brian d foy</a> in 1997 at the 
            First O'Reilly Perl Conference (later to became known as <a href="http://www.oscon.com">OSCON</a>).
        </p>
        
        <h2>Regular Socal Meetings</h2>
        <p>
            NY.pm has "strictly social" meetings approximately once a month. 
            We have been doing so for over 10 years, and you are warmly invited to attend.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no set meeting schedule. Instead, the <a href="mailinglist.html">mailing list</a> is used to
            arrange a convenient date each month.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Emergency social meetings" are also scheduled when Perl Mongers from out of town come to visit.
        </p>
